                            fundraising service for scientists by coaching them on their pitch, filming it, and sharing
                            it with target audiences. Scientists will be able to accumulate a monthly research income to
                            conduct their research over the long term rather than raising funds for one short-term
                            project on their own. Scientists will also not be in danger of losing pledged donations by
                            pre-set deadlines. Donors will be able to make ongoing donations with the option of
                            canceling their subscription mid-way if they are unhappy or unable to continue their
                            donation.</h4></div>

                            This involves coaching scientists on their pitches, capturing those pitches on beautiful
                            film, creating a compelling digital profile where each scientist’s research can be
                            accessible to lay audiences, crafting a digital marketing strategy for each scientist, and
                            even helping scientists deliver public lectures in exchange for public donations to their
                            research. Our dedicated team will tailor an outreach strategy for each scientist’s
                            particular needs.</h4></div>
