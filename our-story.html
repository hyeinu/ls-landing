                    <h1>The Tale of the Fox, the Duck and Science Funding</h1>
                    <h2>By Irena Schneider, Co-Founder and CEO of Lyrical Science</h2>

                    <h3>The Fox</h3>

                    <p>In the fall of 2015, I was a fox. I was rummaging around my desk, busy, frazzled, feeling that
                        particular Ph.D. brand of existential angst. My colleagues and I were training to win the life
                        of ideas. That life was forthcoming, I was sure, as we began patching together a rough quilt of
                        teaching assistant wages, small scholarships and stipends so that we could write the next great
                        book or inspire the next great debate. Like the foxes prancing around my London neighborhood, we
                        became artful, frugal searchers, collectors and storers, hopping timidly but resolutely from one
                        funding opportunity to another.</p>

                    <p>Of course, there was nothing like the gradual discovery that we were preparing for the Olympics,
                        that there were two spots on the team and hundreds of us trying out. Our scavenging habits were
                        only preparation for a fresh wave of post-doctoral scavenging. My colleagues and I philosophized
                        that fall about the practice of survival we were bent on perfecting. We fantasized about ways to
                        solve our funding and career troubles. In the odd mix of late-night caffeinated conversations, I
                        was enchanted by the thought that if academia didn’t have enough resources to keep us, we could
                        somehow resource ourselves. We didn’t have to condition ourselves to uninterrupted
                        helplessness.</p>

                    <p>But things zig-zagged. The wave of inspiration soared and crashed. And everything crashed when I
                        got news of my mother’s cancer diagnosis that fall. You never realize you’re a sitting duck
                        until you get hit.</p>

                    <h3>The Duck</h3>

                    <p>Suddenly I was back home in Baltimore with my mom, absorbing months of hospital visits and the
                        emotional debris, which hit us like daggers. In an attempt to recover our sanity, I reconnected
                        with an old mentor for whom I once interned in high school. Back then, I had helped Leslie
                        distribute colorful greeting cards to brighten cancer patients’ lives as they went through
                        debilitating treatments. A breast cancer survivor herself, Leslie became determined over the
                        years to stop the disease from happening altogether to anyone else.</p>

                    <p>I didn’t properly understand the extent of Leslie’s resilience until she invited me and my mom to
                        a fundraising reception for the Fetting Fund the following fall. Named after Dr. Fetting, their
                        mutual oncologist, Leslie’s initiative offered his team of scientists at Johns Hopkins
                        University an opportunity to vouch for their research on breast cancer prevention. The
                        scientists presented their research on old school poster board and outlined the remedies and
                        early detection methods they were developing to prevent the disease. Federal funding was mostly
                        targeted for disease treatment rather than prevention, leaving the researchers out in the cold.
                        But patients, survivors and their loved ones milled around the scientists. Donations flowed that
                        evening, pushing the existing total endowment of the Fetting Fund to over $4 million.</p>

                    <h3>Overcoming Precarity</h3>

                    <p>Who would have thought that we could keep the world turning despite the precarity we often face
                        as scientists, patients, daughters, sons, friends? Two worlds came together in the battle
                        against cancer that night: a world of scientists accustomed to scavenging for funds, who,
                        despite everything, devote themselves wholeheartedly to research that can save our lives. And a
                        world of unique individuals and their communities striving to re-emerge from the darkest depths
                        of the human experience, ready to fight, to understand, and to live.</p>

                    <p>I was moved, knowing I had had a taste of both worlds. I understood the reality of academic
                        survival even as a social scientist. But I desperately wanted to be part of scientific progress
                        in other fields, simply as a human being with a mom, brother and friends.</p>

                    <p>After months of handwringing, my best friend Hyein and I started discussing science funding with
                        researchers in the natural sciences in Baltimore, New York, Boston and across the UK. After a
                        dozen interviews, we encountered different variations of the old story of academic precarity.
                        Scientists – particularly young scientists—are finding it increasingly difficult to justify
                        their career paths as they face promised funding cuts from their governments and swelling
                        competition for a number of jobs that has hardly changed since the 1980s. The vast majority of
                        scientists with up to a decade of training will end up pursuing other careers, leaving us in an
                        odd dilemma. We live in a society where too many people are equipped to cure cancer or fight
                        climate change, but we are under-curing and under-fighting.</p>

                    <h3>The Promise of Science</h3>

                    <p>Science has always been a powerful means of dealing with the unknown in nature. By reducing our
                        vulnerability to disease or a hostile climate with increasing knowledge, we prolong our
                        longevity and those of future generations. Over time, I’ve come to believe that even as ordinary
                        citizens, we have the ability to repay scientists by reducing their unique vulnerabilities in
                        the struggle for discovery.</p>

                    <p>Lyrical Science is dedicated to young scientists who wish to make a long-term impact in science.
                        Just like musicians can make money off their fan-base, we want to help scientists do the same by
                        sharing their research with the public. Money won’t solve everything, but it can do a lot for
                        scientists who want to test risky but important ideas, build a research team, gain time to make
                        key breakthroughs or climb the shaky career ladder. And it can make a difference for those of us
                        on the other line, whose lives might—and do—depend on it.</p>

                    <p>In reflecting on her initiative, Leslie likes to say, “Don’t be a sitting duck.” Don’t wait for
                        that cancer phone call before you realize you have a stake in scientific discovery. Thinking
                        back to my own experiences and those of my colleagues, I only want to add: it’s time that we
                        stop being fearful foxes, too. Too many of us are vying for a shrinking pot of money, but this
                        isn’t the end of the road. We have fans and it’s time to find them.</p>

                    <h3>Lovers of Science, Unite!</h3>

                    <p>Our journey is only beginning, and we’ll need plenty of feedback as we develop the beta platform
                        to fund scientists through public engagement. This article was the first in a series on science
                        funding, where we’ll be exploring the importance of basic and applied science, the meaning of
                        science in society, and the funding stories of scientists around the world.</p>

                    <p>Sign up here to get all these updates and learn about our upcoming crowdfunding campaign.</p>
