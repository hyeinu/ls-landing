                        scientist, donor or someone who wants updates about the platform. This policy explains what

                    <p>For technical clarification, Lyrical Science is an online platform to fund science through
                        ongoing public donations. The “Platform” refers to our website, through which members of the
                        public view scientist profiles and make ongoing donations to scientific research. Our services
                        on the platform also include offline support to scientists throughout their public funding
                        journey (through coaching, filming and marketing of their scientific research).</p>

                        </li>
                        <li>We also allow donors to access various social networking services ("SNS") such as Facebook,

                        <li>We will use Stripe for payment, analytics, and other business services. When you make a

                            Stripe receives information about you, your transaction, and your payment instrument.
                            Additionally,
                            Stripe collects standard information about your device that may be sufficient to uniquely
                            recognize
                            it. Stripe uses this information to operate and improve the services it provides to us,

                    <p>For Donors, while your donor profile is visible only to you, any elements of your personal
                        information you choose to make public on the website (for instance, by writing a personal note
                        of
                        gratitude to a scientist) can also be seen, collected and used by others viewing the
