                    <h2>Overview</h2>
                    <p>Lyrical science, LLC is an online platform used to fund science through ongoing public donations.
                        The “Platform” refers to our website, through which members of the public view scientist
                        profiles and make ongoing donations to scientific research. Our services on the platform also
                        include offline support to scientists throughout their public funding journey (through coaching,
                        filming and marketing of their scientific research).</p>

                    <p>By accessing the website (the “Site”) lyricalscience.com and/or using any of the services
                        accessible through the Site (the "Services"), you become a user and agree to, and are bound by,
                        these Terms and Conditions. You also agree to our Privacy Policy and any other policies we post
                        on the website.</p>

                    <p>Lyrical Science is a platform. We are not responsible for the timing or legality of content or
                        rewards.</p>

                    <h2>Account Creation for Donors</h2>

                    <p>When you register for an account as a donor, you must provide us with accurate information to

                    <p>To register for an account you must be at least 13 years old. If you know of a user under the age
                        of 13, please report them to us at hi@lyricalscience.com.</p>

                    <p>You are responsible for anything that occurs when someone is signed into your account, as well as
                        the security of the account. If you believe your account is compromised, you must contact us
                        immediately at hi@lyricalscience.com.</p>

                    <h2>Scientist Onboarding</h2>

                    <p>To apply for a position on the platform, you must follow the posted guidelines on
                        lyricalscience.com when they are developed after the Beta stage is complete. We cannot guarantee
                        that your application will be chosen for participation on the platform.</p>

                    <p>If you are chosen for participation, we can choose to terminate your profile and halt funding for

                        onboarding at our discretion.</p>

                    <p>To receive donations on the platform, you must be enrolled in a PhD program or employed in a
                        research position at an accredited university and provide proof of this when you come onboard
                        the platform.</p>

                    <p>Once the onboarding has begun, you are obligated to provide truthful information about yourself,
                        your research program, faculty recommendations, media coverage, publications and any other
                        information you choose to feature on your public profile. We are not liable for any
                        misrepresentations of the above content. We are also under no obligation to feature all of the

                    <p>You will allow our team to coach you, film your pitch, and share it with public supporters on
                        social media channels. Our team will be able to change the presentation of your content only
                        with your permission.</p>

                    <p>Once onboarded, you agree to post monthly updates to your donor base in accordance with
                        lyricalscience.com guidelines.</p>

                    <h2>Scientists’ Involvement with Third Parties</h2>

                    <p>We permit you to link to other websites or resources on the internet in your public profile on
                        our platform. When you access third party sites, you do so at your own risk. These other

                        responsible or liable for the content, functions, accuracy, privacy policies, legality,
                        appropriateness or any other aspect of such websites or resources.</p>

                    <h2>User Conduct</h2>

                    <p>Whether you are a scientist or donor, we can terminate your account if you do any of the

                    <h2>Making Donations</h2>

                    <p>As a donor, you can make ongoing monthly donations to scientists on the platform over the
                        long-term
                        by choosing your time commitment and monthly funding contribution. You will be able to choose
                        these
                        preferences once you are able to setup your account.</p>

                    <p>We have no control over the timing, legality, content or rewards on the platform. We do not grant
                        refunds to donors if scientists fail to achieve their research goals or deliver hopeful
                        findings.</p>

                    <p>Under certain circumstances we may, but are under no obligation to, seek the refund of funding if
                        the scientist misrepresents the research or misuses the funds.</p>

                    <h2>Collecting Donations</h2>

                    <p>We create public profiles for scientists which contain their public video pitch, as well as text
                        which summarizes their research program, media coverage, endorsements, updates and other related
                        content. As a scientist, you appoint us as your agent to collect and process payments on your
                        behalf, and our fee is 10% of your pledges. This fee includes third party payment processing.
                        You
                        are responsible for any taxes you owe based on the payments you receive. You must also follow
                        our
                        rules about content and rewards.</p>

                    <p>In connection with your charges to donors, you appoint us as your limited agent for the sole
                        purpose
                        of receiving, holding, and settling payments to you. As your agent, our receipt of funds from a
                        donor on your behalf is the same as receipt of funds by you directly, and you will only have
                        recourse against us, and not against any donor, for any failure by us to settle funds to
                        you.</p>

                    <p>We will try to provide timely access to your funds, but you may occasionally experience delays in
                        accessing your funds. We may also block or hold payments for violations of the terms or
                        compliance
                        reasons, including collecting tax reporting information. When payments are delayed or blocked we
                        try
                        to communicate the reasons to you promptly. In order to protect scientists, we may block donors’
                        payments if we believe them to be fraudulent.</p>

                    <p>We do not handle most tax payments, but we collect tax identification information and report this
                        to
                        tax authorities as legally required. You are responsible for reporting any taxes.</p>

                    <p>While we endeavour to provide you with fundraising support throughout your time on the platform,
                        we
                        cannot guarantee that your funding goals will be met on the platform.</p>

                    <h2>Account Disabling</h2>

                    <p>You can permanently disable your account, whether as a scientist or patron, at any time. We can
                        also
                        terminate or suspend your account at any time at our discretion. These Terms remain in effect
                        after
                        your account is disabled.</p>

                    <h2>Your Property</h2>

                        from

                    <p>At the same time, you grant us a royalty-free, perpetual, irrevocable, non-exclusive,
                        sublicensable,
                        worldwide license to use, reproduce, distribute, perform, publicly display or prepare derivative

                    <p>Donors may not use content posted by creators in any way not authorized by the scientist.</p>

                    <p>Lyrical Science does not offer warranties of any kind. Any warranty of merchantability, fitness

                    <p>We are specifically not liable for loss associated with your failure to deliver rewards to donors
                        and from losses caused by conflicting contractual agreements.</p>

                    <p>We are also under no obligation to become involved in disputes between scientists and donors or
                        between members of our platform and any third party.</p>
